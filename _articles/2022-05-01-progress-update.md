To get through finishing Vislit as quickly and efficiently as possible, I decided to scrap all user interface work and focus solely on functionality. It wouldn't matter how nice the interface looked if it didn't actually work.

It's taken some two years now, but nearly all the core functionality that I originally wanted for a version 1.0 is actually in the application! I'll be spending the rest of the year implementing my final mockups and will be having progress updates hopefully every month on the state of the project.
