For the proof of concept, my goal was to get a user interface that worked. With that complete, I've spent the past few months focusing on how to architect a user interface in a way that would be easily scalable, testable, and future-proof. It's been slow going but is progressing well.

In between that work, the app is now running again on Windows, Linux, and Mac!
