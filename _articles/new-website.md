After a month of redesigning and a few months of development, Vislit's website has been completely rewritten using Next 12. Re-doing the website as a statically-generated site with real content has been on my to-do list for a while. The original website was a Vue 3 Single Page Application, which was not the ideal solution for a website with few content changes.

With Vislit's prototype fully finished, I felt I had enough content to populate a website. What's here is the application's version 1.0 state along with the mockups I'm basing the interface on. These will be replaced with real screenshots or GIFs once the application is completed.

This site's structure is based on a few different, and amazing, open source projects: Blender, Inkscape, Gimp, Krita, Godot, and Linux Mint.

Once Nuxt 3 is released, I'll slowly be migrating this site over to that, as I'm a bigger fan of Vue than React.
