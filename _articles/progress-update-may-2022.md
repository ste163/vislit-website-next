To develop Vislit as quickly as possible, I decided to hold-off on all user interface work until the functionality was complete. It's taken nearly two years now, but the functionality is finished! Of course, I haven't done any development on a Windows machine in that same amount of time. The project fails to run on Windows right now.

I'll be spending the rest of the year implementing the mockups (and making it run on Windows).
