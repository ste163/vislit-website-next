To develop Vislit as quickly as possible, I decided to hold-off on all user interface work until the functionality was complete. It's taken nearly two years, but the functionality is finished (with a prototype user interface)!

However, I have done no Vislit development on a Windows machine, so Vislit is currently not functioning on Windows.

I'll be spending the rest of the year implementing the mockups (and making it run on Windows).
